## About dwsurvey

DWSurvey questionnaire form 🎉🎉 Since the project was launched in 2012, it has accumulated 12 years of accumulation, and has undergone 6 major framework upgrades. The front-end has completed the transformation from JSP, jQuery to Vue framework. We have served thousands of real clients, including enterprises, government departments, and vocational colleges.

These customers have made us aware of many overlooked details in the questionnaire form and the requirements that will be used in practical scenarios. These feedbacks are like nutrients constantly nourishing the growth of the survey form.

In the 13th year of the DWSurvey questionnaire form 🎉🎉， We have completed the upgrade of VUE3 version and launched a new framework and an open-source version based on Vue. On the path of open source questionnaire forms, we are still moving forward seriously and striving.

If you have any needs or suggestions, please feel free to contact the product team for inquiries, or leave a message directly in the community. We will take every user's voice seriously.

We need your encouragement to do every function with care! Star in the upper right corner 🌟 Follow and wait for you to light up!

## Technical Architecture

The front-end and back-end are completely separated, with Vue2 and Vue3 frameworks provided for implementation. The back-end development language is mainly based on JAVA, integrating service calls through HTTP APIs to achieve business functions. The database is stored in MySQL and Elasticsearch, and the cache is stored in Redis to ensure high performance, reliability, and scalability of the business.

This product's application service supports one click deployment of Docker images, and requires a Docker environment to be prepared on the server in advance. Currently, the community version provides one click installation of Docker images that can be downloaded for free, making the overall implementation relatively simple.

Regarding subsequent updates, upgrading can be done by updating the container image after deployment is completed.
